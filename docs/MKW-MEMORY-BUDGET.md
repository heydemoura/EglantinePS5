# Mario Kart World: where the console's memory goes

Status, 2026-11-05: every title-screen run at 0.5x ends within 120–221 s. All three crash types
come from one cause: the title's single 12 GiB direct-memory pool runs out. The pool holds guest
RAM, the driver's GPU memory, Eden's heap, and everything else at once. The crash types are:

- `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`
- `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`
- `SIGABRT` on a guest CPU thread

Measured with `tools/mkw-bench-console.py` (docs/MKW-BENCHMARK.md).

## Accounting at the crash

From a diagnostics build (`EDEN_MKW_DIAGNOSTICS=ON`, `MKW_MEMORY` every 5 s) with the driver
report on (`RADV_PS5_MEMORY_REPORT=1`):

| Seconds | Guest RAM | Eden heap (+ large) | Eden tables | Driver | Largest free |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | 1.74 GB | 1.04 + 0.17 GB | 0.22 GB | (loading) | 8.09 GB |
| 55 | 4.28 GB | 1.28 + 0.42 GB | 0.24 GB | ~3.9 GB | 1.59 GB |
| 85 | 4.60 GB | 1.38 + 0.42 GB | 0.24 GB | ~4.0 GB | 0.63 GB |
| 145 | 4.88 GB | 1.51 + 0.42 GB | 0.24 GB | 4.22 GB | **4 MiB** |

About 1 GB more is JIT code caches, thread stacks and libraries. The driver's 4.22 GB breaks down
by RADV priority as follows:

- 3.87 GB application memory (VMA)
- 0.26 GB descriptor and upload buffers. This grows through the whole run: 31 → 256 MiB, 822
  objects.
- 0.09 GB shaders

A VMA dump at 80 s shows 3.79 GB of blocks holding 3.26 GB of allocations:

- 0.95 GB render targets, including the game's 8192×8192×68 virtual-texture arrays
- 0.58 GB sampled textures
- 0.60 GB sparse bindings
- 0.53 GB buffers
- 0.53 GB empty space inside blocks

## What does not help

- **The texture collector.** It already measures the pool's largest free block
  (`graphics_usage_from_pool`) and evicts at its hardest when the pool runs short. At the crash
  it scans and finds nothing evictable: the images are in use.
  - Lower limits (`EDEN_NX2_TC_EXPECTED_MIB=4096`, `EDEN_NX2_TC_CRITICAL_MIB=4608`): crash at
    193 s, against 190 s with the defaults.
  - Much lower limits (3584/4096): crash at 133 s and 18 FPS, from re-upload churn.
- **ASTC→BC3.** Switch 2 ASTC is already re-compressed to BC3 on this pool
  (`UseBc3ForSwitch2OnSmallCards`).
- **ProsperoEden's guest-memory states (Zero/Shown).** They save CPU page tables, not memory.
  Eglantine's guest service is already newer here: it keeps a 512 MiB reserve.

## Freed guest pages give their memory back (2026-11-07)

Two bugs kept guest pages the game had freed in host memory until the guest reused them:

- **The derived kernel pool and page heap were never built.** `headless/CMakeLists.txt` set the
  core's sources to a list with `k_memory_manager.cpp` and `k_page_heap.cpp` derived, and the next
  line overwrote it with `kernel.cpp`'s list. The original files were built, so the free hook and the
  optimized-allocation fill rule never ran (`returns_free=0` on every console run).
- **The free hook only saw single frees of a whole 2 MiB slot.** Pages come back in pieces. The hook
  now sits where the guest kernel's page heap merges free buddies: once a free block of 2 MiB or more
  forms, its slots go back. `EDEN_GUEST_FREE_RETURN=0` turns this off.

Measured on MKW 1x (2 interleaved runs of 240 s each). With returns on, `returns_free` was 384–481
and `returns_clear` was 0. Before, the slots had come back later, when the guest cleared them on
reallocation (`returns_clear` 264).

| | Returns on | Off (`=0`) |
|---|---|---|
| Guest memory held at the end | 4.4–4.5 GB | 4.0 GB (at 130 s) |
| FPS | 24.6 / 26.4 | 19.3 / 24.1 |
| Crash at | 163 / 180 s | 130 / 180 s |

The crash stays: the guest really writes ~4.5 GB that it keeps. Freed memory came back on
reallocation before as well, just later.

## Research, 2026-11-07: what fills the pool, and packing cold guest memory

**Where the guest's memory is** (`EDEN_GUEST_POOLS`, every 20 s). All of it is the game's own
application pool: 4.7 GB at 180 s and still growing ~10 MiB/s. The GPU-only regions (system
non-secure pool) hold 0 MiB. A smaller memory layout does not boot: with
`EDEN_NX2_MEMORY_LAYOUT_GB=10` or `8`, MKW jumps to address 0 at 30 s.

**Eden's heap** holds 1.9–2.5 GB, of which 1.4–1.7 GB is in use. Its trim only gives back 32 MiB
pieces with no block in them. The free space inside pieces belongs to the SDK's mspaces, so it
cannot be given back.

**Cold guest memory** (`EDEN_CRAM_COLD_REPORT=1`). At ~160 s, 2.5 GB of 4.4 GB held had not been
written for 60 s or more. Sampled with LZ4, it compresses to **27%** (~0.8 ms per 2 MiB).

### Packing (`EDEN_CRAM_PACK`, on by default)

- **Pack:** while the pool's largest free block is under 1.5 GiB, the scanner LZ4-compresses Own
  slots unwritten for 3+ passes (~60 s). It does up to 512 MiB per pass, coldest first. The block
  goes back, and the slot maps the zero block with no access.
- **Unpack:** any access faults, and the handler unpacks the slot into a new block. It
  decompresses in a separate view and only then maps the block at the slot.
- **Thrash guard:** slots that come back wait twice as long before being packed again.
- **First version bug:** a slot mapped readable for a moment showed zeroes, and a guest thread
  jumped to address 0.

Packing frees 2 MiB blocks all over the pool. The PS5 RADV winsys took each buffer as one run, so
its 64 MiB VMA blocks still failed with ~650 MiB free in 2 MiB blocks. `tools/patch-radv-pieces.py`
builds such a buffer from 2 MiB pieces at its device-region granules.

| MKW 1x, 2 runs of 300 s each | Packing | `EDEN_CRAM_PACK=0` |
|---|---|---|
| Out of device memory at | **203 / 244 s** | 163 / 120 s |
| FPS | 23.9 / 26.3 | 20.9 / 18.9 |
| Packed (stored) | 0.72–1.06 GB (140–185 MiB) | — |
| Unpacked again | 25–56% of packs | — |

The crash moves ~80 s later. It remains: the guest's working set keeps growing, and the heap's
slack (~0.8 GB) and the driver's ~4 GB fill the rest. Next:

- **Heap slack:** an allocator whose free pages can be given back.
- **Packing policy:** fewer slots that come right back, and earlier packing.
- **Texture copies:** packing their guest copy once uploaded.

## The driver's own heap figure counts memory twice

The PS5 winsys reports its whole allocation total for both of its heaps. On MKW, VMA's
`heapUsage` was 7.8 GB with 3.5 GB of VMA blocks, while the per-priority report shows the
driver's true total near 4 GB. Pool-based usage is the default, so this does not change the
collector's decisions. Read the per-priority report rather than `VMA heap N: usage`.

## Where the remaining savings are

1. **Guest RAM: 4.9 GB, still growing at the crash.** The game maps 9.2 GB of its 12 GiB
   layout. Only written 2 MiB slots are held. The 512 MiB guest reserve sits idle while
   graphics allocations fail.
2. **Driver descriptor and upload buffers** grow without bound (≈ +1.5 MiB/s). Check whether
   descriptor pools or command-buffer upload buffers are ever trimmed.
3. **VMA internal fragmentation** (~0.5 GB) and the 0.6 GB of sparse bindings.
4. **Eden's heap** (1.9 GB) grows ~2 MiB/s through the title.

## Tools

- `tools/patch-radv-memory-report.py`: applied to the pinned RADV at driver build time. It
  keeps live bytes and objects per RADV priority. With `RADV_PS5_MEMORY_REPORT=1` in `env.txt`,
  it prints `RADV_PS5_MEMORY pool_mib=… available_mib=… driver_mib=… pN=MiB/count` to stderr at
  most every 10 s. Without the variable it only maintains the counters.
- `EDEN_MKW_DIAGNOSTICS=ON` builds print `MKW_MEMORY` (guest, heap, tables, largest free) every
  5 s.
